# MomentsJS

This web application allows a user to store meetings and events for their day. The events are stored in local storage so that the user may refresh the page and the events remain in their day planner. Moment js is used to display the current date. 

Events that have past are gray, events that are occurring in the present are red, events that are in the future are green.
