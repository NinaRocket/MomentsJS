# MomentsJS

This web application allows a user to store meetings and events for their day. The events are stored in local storage so that the user may refresh the page and the events remain in their day planner. [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) is used to display the current date.

Events that have past are gray, events that are occurring in the present are red, events that are in the future are green. The user will input the event in the text area that displays "Enter event here..." after entering the event, the user will click the blue floppy disc icon to save it to local storage. 

The gif below shows a user saving an event:

The gif below was taken just a couple minutes later as the time changed to 4:00pm, you can see how the color for 4:01pm has changed to reflect that it is now the current time:
